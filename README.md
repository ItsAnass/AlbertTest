Let's discuss: What parts of the code you believe needs to be improved before it can be launched? Let's assume we have a proper database and mail service in place here.

Answer :
Well I think there is a lot of things that needs to be implemented like from my side I see that we still need Generic repository, pagination, filtering and sorting functionalites we need to implement a payment gatway as well as to create API error hanndling controllers and we need Validations also we need more tables in the database like for the orders and the completed orders we also need to work with the customer basket functionality etc.

Its hard to specify exactly what is needed but I can tell that these will be the basics atleast that are needed.
